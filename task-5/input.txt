This feature simplifies your exploration of new ideas. You can use top-level statements for scripting scenarios, or to explore. Once you've got the basics working, you can start refactoring the code and create methods, classes, or other assemblies for reusable components you built. Top-level statements do enable quick experimentation and beginner tutorials. They also provide a smooth path from experimentation to full programs.
