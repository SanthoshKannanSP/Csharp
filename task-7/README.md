# Task-7 - Asynchronous Programming and Multi-threading

## Requirements
- Develop a console application that performs multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.
- Use async and await to fetch data from multiple simulated sources (e.g., using Task.Delay to mimic API calls).
- Aggregate the results once all tasks are complete.
- Handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations.
